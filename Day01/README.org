* Daily Coding Problem - Day 1
** The problem
   Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at
   index ~i~ of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original
   array except the one at ~i~.
   
   For example, if our input was ~[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]~, the expected output would be
   ~[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]~. If our input was ~[3, 2, 1]~, the expected output would
   be ~[2, 3, 6]~.
   
   Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
** My solution
   My solution works for the provided test case and does not use division.
   I feel like I must be missing something, because solving this problem was very
   simple, especially utilizing Python's ~reduce~ function, but this problem
   was still classified as "hard" (finding a linear time solution to the previous
   "easy" problem was much more engaging).
