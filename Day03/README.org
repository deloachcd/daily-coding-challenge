* Daily Coding Problem - Day 3
** The problem
   Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time
   and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not
   exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
   
   For example, the input ~[3, 4, -1, 1]~ should give ~2~. The input ~[1, 2, 0]~
   should give ~3~.
   
   You can modify the input array in-place.
** My solution
   My solution works in linear time, in constant space by continuously swapping elements into
   indices based on their value minus 1 until a conflict is reached.
   
   Credit to this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5414854/remove-duplicates-from-array-in-linear-time-and-without-extra-arrays][StackOverflow]] post for the idea, which I basically just refactored into
   a solution to this problem.
