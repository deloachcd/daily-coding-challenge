* Daily Coding Problem - Day 0
** The problem
   Given a list of numbers and a number ~k~, return whether any two numbers
   from the list add up to ~k~.
   
   For example, given ~[10, 15, 3, 7]~ and ~k~ of ~17~, return ~true~ since ~10 + 7~ is ~17~.
   
   Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
** My solution
   My solution works in linear time (one pass) for lists of positive integers
   and positive k values. I'm pretty sure that getting it work for lists containing
   negative integers and k values would just be a matter of writing a more general
   hashing function, which could be an interesting exercise but exempted on my part
   for the sake of smart time allocation.
